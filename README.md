# LGM-Internship
my recent Data Science internship at LetsGrowMore and the tasks I undertook:
Task-1 Iris Classification with Python
I worked with the Iris dataset, a set of data about different types of iris flowers. My goal was to use Python to classify the flowers based on their features. This taught me the fundamentals of machine learning and how to apply it in real-world scenarios.
Task-2 Turning an Image into a Sketch
Next, I used Python to transform a picture of a cheetah into a sketch. I did this on Google Colab, which made the task smooth and hassle-free. This project was both fun and educational, showing me the potential of image processing.
Task-3 Terrorism Data Exploration
Lastly, I analyzed a dataset about terrorism using Jupyter Notebook. Through this, I learned how to extract meaningful insights from large sets of data, improving my analytical skills.
Key Takeaways This internship was invaluable. Each task honed a different skill:
Iris Classification: Introduced me to practical machine learning.
Image to Sketch: Demonstrated the power of image processing.
Data Exploration: Enhanced my data analysis skills.
To sum it up, my time at Let's Grow More was productive and enlightening. It gave me a clearer idea of what I can do with data and programming, and I'm eager to take on more challenges in the future. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to LetsGrowMore and Aman Kesarwani for providing me with this invaluable opportunity.
